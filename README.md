### Experience

In the Firework Factory, you can customize virtual fireworks, share your favorites, watch them explode from any angle, and even control time itself! Drift slowly amongst bullet-time fireworks passing by, get up-close-and-personal with the most explosive fireworks, view a slow zen-like firework implosion, or anywhere in-between. The entire experience is up to you.
